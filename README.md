# Rootbeer

Rootbeer is meant to be a really crappy knock-off of nix's home-manager.

It will be packaged together as a usable CLI tool!

It's going to consist of 3 important parts that make an entire system together:
- A lua interpreter so that configurations can be defined within a lua script
- A system to manage stores/revisions of configurations (like nix's store)
- A module system to define all sorts of customization functionality in the lua script

> This description sucks and will expand as I work on this project more!
